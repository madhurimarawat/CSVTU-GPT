    "## Text Data Preprocessing for CSVTU Website Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This process focuses on transforming raw textual data scraped from the CSVTU (Chhattisgarh Swami Vivekanand Technical University) website into a structured and machine-readable format, optimizing it for machine learning tasks. The key steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective**:\n",
    "   - The aim is to convert unstructured scraped data into a clean and structured *question-answer (QA)* format suitable for training machine learning models, particularly those designed for natural language understanding.\n",
    "   - Additionally, the syllabus of B.Tech Honors in Data Science will be extracted and structured into a well-defined format for easier processing and access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Steps**:\n",
    "   - **Scraped Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "     - Remove unnecessary HTML tags, JavaScript, and redundant information using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` for parsing and cleaning.\n",
    "     - Normalize the text by converting it to lowercase and removing special characters, numbers, and stopwords that do not contribute to the QA format.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Tokenization and Segmentation**:\n",
    "     - Split the text into meaningful sentences and paragraphs, ensuring logical separation between topics.\n",
    "     - Identify and categorize content into questions, answers, and explanatory text using text segmentation algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Formatting into QA Pairs**:\n",
    "     - Extract questions directly stated or implied in the text, ensuring they align with the answers provided.\n",
    "     - Create synthetic questions (if necessary) based on the content using techniques like question-generation models or templates.\n",
    "     - Structure the data as key-value pairs where each question is paired with its respective answer for easier integration into machine learning pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Syllabus Structuring**:\n",
    "     - Focus on extracting the syllabus for the B.Tech Honors in Data Science program.\n",
    "     - Organize the syllabus into a hierarchical format (e.g., semesters, subjects, modules).\n",
    "     - Ensure consistency in terminology and formatting, such as using predefined headers like \"Semester 1: Core Subjects.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Formats**:\n",
    "   - **QA Format**:\n",
    "     - Save the question-answer pairs into a CSV file where:\n",
    "       - Column 1: Question\n",
    "       - Column 2: Answer\n",
    "     - This format ensures compatibility with most machine learning frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Syllabus File**:\n",
    "     - Create a separate structured document for the B.Tech syllabus in a machine-readable format like JSON or a tabular format like CSV.\n",
    "     - Include metadata such as subject codes, credit hours, and descriptions for a comprehensive dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits**:\n",
    "   - **Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for manual data preparation or reliance on external APIs for similar tasks.\n",
    "   - **Scalability**: Enables the creation of large-scale QA datasets and structured syllabi for diverse applications, from search engines to chatbots."
